# Notes for maintainers

## `ClientApi.cs`

The file `ClientApi.cs` is generated by [ProtoBuf](https://protobuf.dev/)
from [the SpacetimeDB client-api-messages proto definition](https://github.com/clockworklabs/SpacetimeDB/blob/master/crates/client-api-messages/protobuf/client_api.proto).
This is not automated.
Whenever the `client_api.proto` changes, you'll have to manually re-run `protoc` to re-generate the definitions.

```sh
cd ~/clockworklabs/SpacetimeDB/crates/client-api-messages/protobuf
protoc --csharp_out=/absolute/path/to/spacetimedb-csharp-sdk/src \
  ./client_api.proto
```

Note that `protoc` cannot understand paths that start with `~`;
you must write the absolute path starting from `/`.
